Word scrambling game where:
- User is prompted with a word and gets points for each word they create out of characters from the originally presented word
- Score is kept track of above and user is able to try a new word at the click of a button
- Valid words are added (with transition) to list below original word
- Invalid words (too short, not original to list, invalid character use) are prompted with alert for specific error
